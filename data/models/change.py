"""
ðŸ’¡ WHAT:
Pydantic model to define 1 suggestion change
(a suggestion being composed of 1 or more changes)

So we have:
Suggestion.suggestion["changes"] = list[SuggestionChange]

TODO: I propose to rename Suggestion.suggestion to .changes
to have Suggestion.changes = list[SuggestionChange], whatever
is currently in .suggestion and not destined to .changes should
be moved to some metadata field

ðŸŽ¯ WHY:
The change being nested within a suggestion field,
we don't want to use Django models to validate the data
(DB model = Django, Non-DB Models = Pydantic)

ðŸ”¢ HOW:
If we step back and look at the bigger picture:
 - we start with a Suggestion
 - on which we do Suggestion.apply()
 - which does:

changes = self.suggestion["changes"]
changes.sort(key=lambda x: x["order"])
for change in changes:
     SuggestionChange(**change).apply()
